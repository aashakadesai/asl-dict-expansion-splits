This repository contains splits used for dictionary expansion experiments in EMNLP 2025 paper titled <i>Investigating Dictionary Expansion for Video Based Sign Language Dictionaries. </i>

All splits were derived from the original ASL Citizen train, validation, and test splits. To learn more about how these splits were sampled, read section 3.3 and 3.4 of the EMNLP paper. 

Each folder contains core and unseen vocabulary splits for training, validation, and testing. 

'big_dict_experiments' folder contains core-unseen vocabulary splits of 1000 and 1731 glosses respectively. We also provide user-specific subsets used in our experiements. 

'small_dict_experiments' folder contains core-unseen vocabulary splits of 100 and 2631 glosses respectively.
